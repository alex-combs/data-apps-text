# R Nonlinear Regression

## Learning Objectives

In this chapter, you will learn how to:

- Run a regression with a quadratic term
- Run a regression with log transformations

## Set-up

To complete this chapter, you need to

- Start a R Markdown document
- Change the YAML to at least the following. Feel free to add arguments.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
---
title: 'R Chapter 22'
author: 'Your name'
output: 
  html_document:
    theme: spacelab
    df_print: paged
---
```
- Load the following packages

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(moderndive)
library(carData)
```

We will use the `Mroz` dataset within the `carData` package. Be sure to view the documentation for these data in the Help tab of the bottom-right pane by typing the name of the dataset in the search bar.

## Quadratic term

Recall the below regression model from Chapter \@ref(nonlinear-variables) that includes a squared term for `Age`, which allows our regression line to change directions once as `Age` changes. We included this term because Figure \@ref(fig:quadscatter) suggested wages initially increase with age, then decreases.

\begin{equation}
Wage = \beta_0 + \beta_1Age + \beta_2Age^2 + \beta_3Educ + \epsilon
\end{equation}

The below code demonstrates how to include a quadratic term within the `lm` function.

```{r}
quad_mod <- lm(Wage ~ Age + I(Age^2) + Educ, data = wages)
```

In this case, the code reflects the equation only somewhat; the `I()` is necessary to tell R that `Age^2` is the squared version of `Age`. Otherwise, R would not recognize `Age^2` in the data, thus excluding it from the regression.

Now we can obtain results in the usual manner.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
get_regression_table(quad_mod)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
get_regression_table(quad_mod) %>% 
  kable(format = 'html')
```

We need to alter the `Mroz` data slightly before running a regression. Run the following code that creates a new variable that equals 1 if `lfp` equals "yes" and 0 if `lfp` equals "no." This is necessary because our outcome variable--even though categorical--must be represented numerically in order for the regression to work.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
my_Mroz <- Mroz %>% 
  mutate(lfp_numeric = if_else(lfp == "yes", 1, 0))
```


```{block, type='learncheck', purl=FALSE}
**Exercise 1:** Suppose we want to examine factors that explain whether married women participate in the labor force, which is a binary outcome. We use the following model:

\begin{equation}
lfp = \beta_0 + \beta_1k5 + \beta_2age + \beta_3age^2 + \beta_4wc + \beta_5lwg + \beta_6inc + \epsilon
\end{equation}

Run this regression model and obtain the results.
```

## Log Transformation

In Chapter \@ref(nonlinear-variables), the following log-log regression model was run.

\begin{equation}
ln(LifeExp)=\beta_0 + \beta_1ln(GDPpercap) + \beta_2Continent + \epsilon
\end{equation}

The below code demonstrates how to transform a variable into its natural log within the `lm` function.

```{r}
loglog <- lm(log(lifeExp) ~ log(gdpPercap) + continent, data = gapminder)
```

Note that all we need to do is place the appropriate variables within the `log()` function, which R interprets as the natural log. This *temporarily* transforms the variables; it does not create new variables in the dataset equal to the natural log of the variables.

Now we can obtain results in the usual manner.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
get_regression_table(loglog)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
get_regression_table(loglog) %>% 
  kable(format = 'html')
```

```{block, type='learncheck', purl=FALSE}
**Exercise 2:** Suppose we decide we want to use the natural log of family income exclusive of wife's income, `inc`, resulting in the following model

\begin{equation}
lfp = \beta_0 + \beta_1k5 + \beta_2age + \beta_3age^2 + \beta_4wc + \beta_5lwg + \beta_6ln(inc) + \epsilon
\end{equation}

Run this regression model and obtain the results.
