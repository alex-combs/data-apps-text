# R Evaluations

## Learning Outcomes

In this chapter, you will learn how to:

- Conduct a chi-square test
- Conduct an independent t-test

## Set-up

To complete this chapter, you need to

- Start a R Markdown document
- Change the YAML to at least the following. Feel free to add arguments.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
---
title: 'R Chapter 23'
author: 'Your name'
output: 
  html_document:
    theme: spacelab
    df_print: paged
---
```

- Load the following packages

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(carData)
library(MASS)
```

For the chi-square test, we will use the `MplsStops` dataset within the `carData` package. For the t-tests, we will use the `UScrime` dataset within the `MASS` package. Be sure to view the documentation for these data in the Help tab of the bottom-right pane by typing the name of the dataset in the search bar.

## Chi-square test

A chi-square test, like the one demonstrated in Chapter \@ref(hypothesis-testing), requires two steps:

- Create a cross-tabulation table using the `table` function
- Run the chi-square on the cross-tabulation using the `chisq.test` function

### Cross-tab

Below is the code used to produce the cross-tab from Chapter \@ref(hypothesis-testing). I save the new table as `polltable`. Using the `table` function, I tell R which two variables from the `poll` dataset to cross-tabulate. The `$` is how we identify a specific variable within a dataset. The levels of the first variable, `response`, will be tabulated by row, while the frequency of the levels of the second variable, `party`, will be tabulated by column. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
polltable <- table(poll$response, poll$party)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
polltable <- table(poll$response, poll$party)
kable(polltable, caption = 'Response by political party')
```

### Run chi-square

Now that we have a cross-tabulation table, we can run the chi-square test. The code below demonstrates how.

```{r}
chisq.test(immigration_poll)
```

Then, it is simply a matter of interpreting the results.

```{block, type='learncheck', purl=FALSE}
**Exercise 1:** Using the `MplsStops` data, suppose we wanted to test whether receiving a citation after being stopped by the police, `citationIssued`, is independent of `race.` Both are nominal variables, so a chi-square test can be used. Run this chi-square test.
```

```{block, type='learncheck', purl=FALSE}
**Exercise 2:** Are the two variables independent? Why?
```

## T-tests

To reiterate, if the two groups in a t-test are comprised of different subjects, we use an independent t-test. If they are comprised of the same subjects, then we use a dependent t-test.

### Independent t-test

The code below demonstrates how the independent t-test from Chapter \@ref(hypothesis-testing) was conducted. The `t.test` function works a lot like the `lm` function in that the outcome is entered first, then we input the variable that identifies the groups, which is essentially an explanatory variable. The two variables are separated by `~`. Then, we tell R which dataset to use, which is called `jobtrain` in this case.

```{r}
t.test(earnings ~ treatment, data = jobtrain)
```

```{block, type='learncheck', purl=FALSE}
**Exercise 3:** Using the `UScrimes` data, suppose we wanted to test whether the probability of imprisonment, `Prob`, is independent of between Southern and non-Southern states, `So`. The outcome is numerical and the explanatory is nominal. Therefore, a t-test can be used. Run this t-test.
```

```{block, type='learncheck', purl=FALSE}
**Exercise 4:** Is there an association between the two variables? Why?
```

### Dependent t-test

To conduct a dependent t-test, add the option `paired=TRUE` inside the `t.test` code like so

```{r, eval=FALSE}
t.test(earnings ~ treatment, data = jobtrain, paired = TRUE)
```

However, this code will not work because the number of observations in the treatment and control groups are not equal. If we truly had a paired sample where the same subjects measured twice, then we should have the same number of observations in both groups.
