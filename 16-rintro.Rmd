# (PART) R Chapters {-}

# R Introduction

This part of the book contains what are referred to as R chapters that correspond to chapters in previous parts of the book. Though previous chapters use R to present information, they focus on concepts that are applicable regardless of statistical software. R chapters take those concepts and present ways to practically apply them via a short series of exercises using R.

## R chapter structure

Each R chapter begins with a list of learning objectives followed by a what you need to set up in terms of packages and datasets to complete the chapter.

Each chapter then guides you through a few exercises that require you to operate R. Periodically, they will ask you to interpret your results or connect what you have done to the concept it was meant to help you understand.

By the end of each chapter, you will have at least one document to save and submit. That document will contain code and answers to questions. Some chapters may ask you to generate an output document such as PDF, Word, or HTML. 

## R chapter feedback

Once you submit your work to the course site on eLC, a document will become available that contains answers prepared by your instructor. This document is meant to provide nearly immediate feedback.

You should compare your work to that of your instructor, making note of any differences and attempting to make sense of them. At the beginning of each class, we will review the corresponding R chapter if students have questions.

## What is R and RStudio

R is a programming language for statistical computing. RStudio is a user interface for R. These two programs are analogous to a smart phone. Your phone has base code you never interact with directly but is what allows your phone to work. You interact with this code, doing all the cool things it allows you to do through what you see on the screen. R is like the base code for your phone. RStudio is like the screen.

## Installing R and RStudio

First, download and install R [here](https://cloud.r-project.org/).

- **Windows user:** click on "Download R for Windows", then click on "base", then click on "Download R #.#.# for Windows."
- **MacOS user:**, click on "Download R for (Mac) OS X." What you click on next depends on what version of macOS you are using. Under "Latest release," you will see a link such as "R-#.#.#.pkg" with a description to the right that indicates which versions of macOS it is compatible with, such as macOS 10.13 (High Sierra) and higher. If you are using an older version of macOS, scroll down to the header "Binaries for legacy OS X systems" where you can find the link that will work with your version. If you do not know which version of macOS you are using, click on the apple symbol in the top-left of your screen, then click on "About This Mac." The resulting window will display your version of macOS.

Second, download and install RStudio [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

- Click on the download link beneath the "RStudio Desktop" version that is "FREE."
- The website should automatically provide a link under step 2 to download the version of RStudio recommended for your computer.

## RStudio orientation

```{block, type='learncheck', purl=FALSE}
**Exercise 1**  Launch RStudio
```

Upon launch, you should see three panes:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
include_graphics('images/rstudio_sshot.png')
```

- Console pane (left) is where you can tell R what to do. It also displays the results of commands. **Only use the console for installing packages.**
- Environment pane (top right) displays all the data in your current R session. A session is the time between launching and closing R.
- Files pane (bottom right) allows you to navigate your files, displays plots, provides a list of installed packages, allows you to search for help, and displays file exports.

You will usually see a fourth pane while working in RStudio -- the source editor pane. 

```{block, type='learncheck', purl=FALSE}
**Exercise 2** In the RStudio menu bar at the top of your screen, go to `File -> New File -> R Script`. A new pane will open. **This is the pane where you will tell R what to do 99% of the time because it allows you to do so while creating a document you can save.**
```

### R Packages

Many tasks in R require you to install R packages that augment its functionality. Extending the smartphone analogy from above, your phone comes with base programs (e.g. calendar, weather), but others create third-party applications to augment the functionality of your phone. This is also the case with R, which has an active user community that develops useful third-party apps called packages.

#### Install {-}
Just like your phone, you have to first install a R package to use it. Install packages by typing the following code **into the console pane**.

```{r installdemo, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("name_of_package")
```

You only need to install a package once. The package is saved on your computer where R can find it.

```{block, type='learncheck', purl=FALSE}
**Exercise 3** We will almost always need to use a package called `tidyverse`. In your console pane of RStudio, type `install.packages("tidyverse")`, then click `Enter` on your keyboard. This will begin the installation. Monitor the console while the package installs. RStudio may ask you some Yes/No questions during the process. Answer all questions in the affirmative by typing `Yes` then clicking `Enter`.
```

#### Load {-}
When an app is installed on our phone, you still have to launch it to use it. The same goes for using a R package. Each time you launch RStudio, you need to load the package(s) whose functions you plan to use. Therefore, loading packages should be done in the source editor. The following generic code is used to load a package.

```{r loaddemo, eval=FALSE}
library(name_of_package)
```

Note that to load a package, we do not use quotation marks around the name like we do when installing.

```{block, type='learncheck', purl=FALSE}
**Exercise 4**  You should have a script open in the source editor (upper-left) pane. Type `library(tidyverse)` in the script. Click `Run` or `Cmd+Enter` to execute this line of code. The console pane will provide information about the loading.
```

You must load a package before using any functions included in that package or else you will receive the following error message, `Error: could not find function`. Remember this crucial fact. I will tell you what packages are needed for certain tasks, but remember that you need to install and load the package to use it.

## Submit

Please save your script using your last name and submit to eLC. Once you submit, answers will become available for download.

## Additional Resources

There are many resources that provide orientations to R. Below are a few that offer a thorough and accessible introduction.
