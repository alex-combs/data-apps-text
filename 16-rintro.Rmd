# (PART) R Chapters {-}

# R Chapter Introduction

This section contains what are referred to as R Chapters, each of which corresponds to a chapter in the previous section. Chapters in the previous section focus on concepts that are applicable regardless of statistical software. R Chapters present those concepts in ways to practically apply them via a short series of exercises using R.

Each R Chapter begins with a list of learning objectives followed by a what you need to set up in terms of packages and data to complete the chapter. Each chapter then guides you through a few exercises that require you to operate R. Periodically, they will ask you to interpret your results and/or connect what you have done to the concept it was meant to help you understand. By the end of each chapter, you will have at least one document to save and upload to eLC. That document will contain code and answers to questions. 

Once you upload your R Chapter work to eLC, a document will become available that contains my answers to those same exercises. This is meant to provide almost immediate feedback. You should compare your work to my own, making note of any differences and attempting to make sense of them. Keep in mind that my answers are not necessarily definitive. R Chapters will be incorporated into class discussion when possible, but feel free to ask specific questions about each R Chapter during class.

## What is R and RStudio

R is a programming language for statistical computing. RStudio is a user interface for R. These two programs are analogous to a smart phone. Your phone has base code you never interact with directly but is what allows your phone to work. Similarly, you should never have to launch and interact with R on your computer. Instead, you interact with this code, doing all the cool things it allows you to do through what you see on the screen. RStudio is like the screen of your phone.

## Installing R and RStudio

First, download and install R [here](https://cloud.r-project.org/).

- **Windows user:** click on "Download R for Windows", then click on "base", then click on "Download R #.#.# for Windows."
- **MacOS user:**, click on "Download R for (Mac) OS X." What you click on next depends on what version of macOS you are using. Under "Latest release," you will see a link such as "R-4.2.1.pkg" with a description to the right that indicates which versions of macOS it is compatible with, such as macOS 10.13 (High Sierra) and higher. **Note there are different packages to download depending on whether your machine has Apple silicon (M1 or M2). If your Mac uses an Intel chip, do not download the package for Apple silicon.** If you are using a version of macOS older than 10.13 (High Sierra), scroll down to the header "Binaries for legacy OS X systems" where you can find the link that will work with your version. If you do not know which version of macOS you are using, click on the apple symbol in the top-left of your screen, then click on "About This Mac." The resulting window will display your version of macOS.

Second, download and install RStudio [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

- Click on the download link beneath the "RStudio Desktop" version that is "FREE."
- The website should automatically provide a link under step 2 to download the version of RStudio recommended for your computer.

## RStudio orientation

```{block, type='learncheck', purl=FALSE}
**Exercise 1**  Launch RStudio
```

Upon launch, you should see three sections referred to as panes:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
include_graphics('images/rstudio_sshot.png')
```

- Console pane (left) is where you can tell R what to do. It also displays the results of commands and any messages, warnings, and errors. You will rarely need to use the console except when installing a package. **Only install a package via the console, never as code you would save and (re)run.**
- Environment pane (top right) displays all the data in your current R session. A session is the time between launching and closing R.
- Files pane (bottom right) allows you to navigate your files, displays plots, provides a list of installed packages, allows you to search for help, and displays file exports.

You will usually see a fourth pane in the upper-left, with the console in the bottom-left, while working in RStudio -- the source editor pane. 

```{block, type='learncheck', purl=FALSE}
**Exercise 2** Two options: 1) See that plus sign (+) icon with a piece of paper in the very top left of RStudio? Click on that and you will see a list of options. In this course, we will always use R Markdown documents. Select R Markdown. 2) In the RStudio menu bar at the top of your screen, go to `File -> New File -> R Markdown`. Either way, a dialog box will appear. You do not need to do anything other than click `OK`. A new pane should appear with some default content in it. **This is the pane where you will tell R what to do 99% of the time because it allows you to write code that you can save.**
```

### R Markdown

An R Markdown document allows you to fluidly combine prose that you would write for a report and R code that produces the tables and graphs you wish to incorporate. It can do much more than this, as outlined by this brief [video](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html). In this course, we will use R Markdown for R Labs and Problem Sets in addition to these R Chapters.

An R Markdown file consists of two parts:
- YAML Header: at the top contained within three dash marks. The YAML sets the global options for the document and how it exports; typically used to adjust the formatting of the export document.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
---
title: "This is a YAML"
output: html_document
---
```
- Body: where you write prose and code

Be sure to read the default content, as it is informative.

```{block, type='learncheck', purl=FALSE}
**Exercise 3** In the YAML, change the title to "R Chapter 16".
```

```{block, type='learncheck', purl=FALSE}
**Exercise 4** Click on the `Knit` button at the top of the source editor pane (looks like a ball of yarn with a needle stuck in it. A drop down menu will appear. Click on HTML. RStudio will then prompt you to save your document. Save your R Markdown file using your last name (`lastname_rch16`) wherever on your computer you prefer. R will start to process your document and a new window will appear that contains your export document. Feel free to test knitting to Word if your computer has Word installed. PDF will not yet work. RStudio saves your document every time you knit.
```

### R Packages

Many tasks in R require you to install R packages that augment its functionality. Extending the smartphone analogy from before, your phone comes with base programs (e.g. calendar, weather), but others develop third-party applications to augment the functionality of your phone. This is also the case with R, which has an active community that develops useful third-party apps called packages.

#### Install Packages{-}

Just like your phone, you have to first install a R package to use it. In your phone's case, you go to your app store and download an application that will then show up on your screen. 

Installing packages via RStudio is essentially the same. To install R packages, we type the following generic code **into the console pane** (bottom-left).

```{r installdemo, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("name_of_package")
```

Where `"name_of_package"` is replaced with the actual name of the R package we want to install. This code accesses R's "app store" and downloads it to your computer. You only need to install a R package once. The package is saved on your computer where R can find it.

<br>

> Remember to include quotes around the name of the R package when installing it.

<br>

```{block, type='learncheck', purl=FALSE}
**Exercise 5** We will almost always need to use a package called `tidyverse`. In your **console pane** (bottom-left) of RStudio, type `install.packages("tidyverse")`, then click `Enter` on your keyboard. This will begin the installation. Monitor the console pane while `tidyverse` installs. RStudio may ask you some Yes/No questions during the process. Answer all questions in the affirmative by typing `Yes` then clicking `Enter`.
```

You can install multiple R packages at once. You will need numerous R packages to complete this course. Below is a list of all R packages used in this course.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("tidyverse",
                   "knitr",
                   "arsenal",
                   "forecast",
                   "fpp2",
                   "lubridate",
                   "readxl",
                   "plm",
                   "broom",
                   "car",
                   "gvlma",
                   "gapminder",
                   "Ecdat",
                   "carData",
                   "openintro",
                   "fivethirtyeight",
                   "moderndive",
                   "DAAG",
                   "Stat2Data",
                   "data.table",
                   "rmarkdown",
                   "tinytex",
                   "DiagrammeR",
                   "jtools",
                   "blogdown",
                   "stargazer"))
```

Complete the following exercise to download all of the R packages needed for the course. 

```{block, type='learncheck', purl=FALSE}
**Exercise 6** In your **console pane** (bottom-left) of RStudio, copy-and-paste the above code and list of packages, then click `Enter`. This will begin the installation. RStudio may ask you some Yes/No questions during the process. Answer all questions in the affirmative by typing `Yes` then clicking `Enter`.
```

#### Load Packages {-}

When an application is installed on your phone, you still have to launch it (i.e. click on it) to use it. The same goes for using a R package. Each time you launch RStudio, you need to load the package(s) that contain the functions you plan to use. Closing RStudio is like shutting off your phone. When you open your phone, an application isn't running in the background unless you previously launched it. 

Therefore, you should load needed R packages each time you open RStudio. And because you want your code to work each time you or someone else tries to run it, you should include this in your saved code. This means you should load R packages in the source editor pane (top-left) whether it be an R script of R markdown document. The following generic code is used to load a package.

```{r loaddemo, eval=FALSE}
library(name_of_package)
```

> Do not use quotes around the name of the R package when loading it. Quotes are only needed to install, not load.

```{block, type='learncheck', purl=FALSE}
**Exercise 7**  Near the top of your document, you should see a code chunk named `setup` containing the code `knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)`. Start a new line *inside* of this code chunk. Type `library(tidyverse)` on the new script. Next, run this code chunk either by clicking on the little sideways arrow at the right of the code chunk, or by using the keyboard shortcut `Cmd+Enter` on Mac or `Ctrl+Enter` or `Window+Enter` on PC. This shortcut only executes the line of code on which your cursor (the blinking vertical line) is. The console pane (bottom-left) will provide information about the loading.
```

<br>

> Remember, you must load a package before using any functions included in that package or else you will receive the following error message, `Error: could not find function`. I will tell you what packages are needed to complete all assignments, but remember that you need to install and load the package to use it.

## Save and Upload

Save your document once more either by knitting again or like any other software -- clicking on the floppy disk icon in the menu at the top or using the menu bar `File -> Save As`. Then upload your .Rmd document to eLC. Once you upload, answers will become available on the Welcome module of eLC.

## Additional Resources

There are many resources that provide orientations to R. Below are a two that I consider particularly helpful and accessible.
