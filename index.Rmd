# Preface {-}

This is a collection of lecture and presentation notes compiled into a format that could be mistaken as a textbook. It is not a textbook nor is it intended to compete with published textbooks. It is a resource for students enrolled in my sections of PADP 7120: Data Applications in Public Administration. Distribution beyond that is discouraged. This resource is not peer-reviewed. All subjective remarks as well as errors are my own. I do not benefit monetarily from this resource in any way.

This resource was primarily developed out of uncertainty regarding the future of in-person teaching. If in-person instruction were to become untenable due to COVID-19, my thinking was that this resource would offer a substitute for the time spent in class distilling readings into what I want students to know. This resource provides one-way lessons from the person in charge of evaluating your understanding and application of key concepts and skills.

Ultimately, the objective of this resource is to help students in PA7120 be as competitive as possible in their desired job markets via competency in statistics and statistical programming software. It aims to teach students key concepts in statistics and applications of those concepts using R with minimal need to sift through excessively theoretical or technical material.

### Style and Structure {-}

Rather than provide thorough coverage of complex statistical concepts, I take some liberty to present stylized facts for the benefit of the reader. When using R, multiple options exist to achieve an outcome. I provide what I consider or understand to be the best option. You may be aware of or discover what you consider a better approach. I welcome such suggestions for improvement!

Chapters are organized along two tracks. The first track covers statistical concepts and is self-contained. The second track applies the concepts in the first track using R. The chapters in the applied track are referred to as R chapters, each of which corresponds to a conceptual chapter in the first track. For example, the `R Data` chapter corresponds to the `Data` chapter in the first track.

The conceptual track is divided into four sections:

1. Data and description
2. Regression models
3. Inference
4. Advanced topics

Examples and exercises are presented using R. Students who intend to use a personal computer to complete exercises in the R chapters need to download and install the following software:

- [R](https://cloud.r-project.org)
- [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
