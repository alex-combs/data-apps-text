# Preface {-}

This is a collection of lecture and presentation notes intended as a resource for students enrolled in my sections of PADP 7120: Data Applications in Public Administration. Distributing this resource beyond those enrolled in PADP 7120 is discouraged. This resource is not peer-reviewed. All opinions and errors are my own. I do not benefit monetarily from this resource in any way.

The objective of this resource is to help students in PADP 7120 become as competitive as possible in their desired job markets via competency in statistics and statistical programming software. It aims to teach students key concepts in statistics and applications of those concepts using R with a level of theoretical and technical detail that is appropriate for those pursing a Masters in Public Administration.

## Style and Structure {-}

Rather than provide thorough coverage of complex theory, I take some liberty to present stylized facts for the benefit of the reader. When using R, it is often the case that multiple options exist to achieve a desired result. I provide what I consider or understand to be the best option.

Chapters are organized along two tracks. The first track covers statistical concepts and is self-contained. The second track applies the concepts in the first track using R. The chapters in the applied track are referred to as R Chapters, each of which corresponds to a chapter in the first track. For example, the `R Data` chapter corresponds to the `Data` chapter in the first track.

The conceptual track is divided into four sections:

1. Data and description
2. Regression models
3. Inference
4. Advanced topics

Examples and exercises are presented using R. Students who intend to use a personal computer to complete exercises in the R chapters need to download and install the following software:

- [R](https://cloud.r-project.org)
- [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

```

```{r set-options, include=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
# Set output options
if (is_html_output()) {
  options(width = 80)
}
if (is_latex_output()) {
  options(width = 75)
}
options(digits = 7, bookdown.clean_book = TRUE, knitr.kable.NA = "NA")
opts_chunk$set(
  tidy = FALSE,
  out.width = "\\textwidth",
  fig.align = "center",
  comment = NA
)

# To get kable tables to print nicely in .tex file
if (is_latex_output()) {
  options(kableExtra.auto_format = FALSE, knitr.table.format = "latex")
}
```
